# Week 4: Predictive Modeling 

## Overview
We are focusing on building predictive models to forecast restaurant ratings based on various features. We also evaluate the models using multiple metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. The goal is to create accurate models that can predict restaurant ratings and analyze their performance using different models
## Tasks 
### Feature Engineering
- Extract additional features from existing columns.
- Create new features by encoding categorical variables.

### Model Building
- Build regression models to predict restaurant ratings.
- Split data into training and testing sets

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to determine their performance.
- Compare different algorithms like linear regression and random fore

## Key Insights
- Predictive models using regression techniques like linear regression and random forest will help in understanding the key factors driving restaurant ratings.
- Feature engineering and model evaluation are critical for improving prediction accuracy.
